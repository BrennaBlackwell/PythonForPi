Create directory on each pi that images can be stored and accessed by all group partners 
I think /home/pi/images/ will work










-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Directories and their use/meaning
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

/home/pi/images/
All group memebers will be using this directory when sending images to and from pis. 

/home/pi/algo2/transferedFiles/
This is for my programs use only. It is to store *.sh files that are to be ran on the leaf node
